## Welcome to ArboratorGrew Documentation

This is the official user documentation for **[ArboratorGrew](https://arboratorgrew.elizia.net/#/)**

?> A **collaborative annotation** tool for the **treebank** developpement. 

Below is brief summary of Arborator's main features and user cases. For more details and tutorials, use the navigation bar on the left. 

Let's have a look at the documentation.


## Main Features

Arborator-Grew combines the features of two preexisting tools: `Arborator` and `Grew`. 

> **[Arborator](https://arborator.ilpga.fr/)** is a widely used collaborative graphical online dependency treebank
annotation tool. 

> **[Grew](https://grew.fr/)** is a tool for graph querying and rewriting specialized in structures needed in NLP, i.e. syntactic and semantic
dependency trees and graphs. Grew also has an online version, **[Grew-match](http://match.grew.fr/)**, where all Universal Dependencies treebanks in their classical,
deep and surface-syntactic flavors can be queried.

> **[ArboratorGrew](https://arboratorgrew.elizia.net/#/)** opens up new paths of collectively
creating, updating, maintaining, and curating syntactic treebanks and semantic graph banks.

> **[ArboratorGrew](https://arboratorgrew.elizia.net/#/)** is adapted better to
**[UD Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/)** (Treebank annotation grammar) and **[SUD Surface Syntactic Universal Dependencies](https://surfacesyntacticud.github.io/)** (Distribution based version of UD).
